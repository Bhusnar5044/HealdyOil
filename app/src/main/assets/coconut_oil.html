      There are two main methods of extracting<br>
      coconut oil – dry processing or wet processing.<br>
      Dry processing involves heating the meat of<br>
      the coconut, for example, with fire or<br>
      sunlight. This meat is then pressed or<br>
      dissolved, leaving two substances<br>
      – the coconut oil and a high fibre mass,<br>
      which is unsuitable for human consumption<br>
      but can be fed to ruminants.Wet processing<br>
      uses the raw coconut rather than<br>
      the heated and dried meat in order to<br>
      produce the coconut oil.<br>
      In order to recover the oil, centrifuges<br>
      or enzymes can be used.<br>
      Generally, wet processing results in a<br>
      lower yield than dry processing.<br>
