    <h3>Sunflower oil:</h3>
    <font face="Arial" color="DIMGRAY">
      Sunflower oil is a non-volatile oil that<br>
      can be easily extracted from sunflowers.<br>
      Although most people are already familiar<br>
      with sunflowers, they donâ€™t immediately<br>
      think of sunflowers as sources of an<br>
      extremely healthy vegetable oil that<br>
      can replace some of the less healthy<br>
      cooking oils available on the market.<br>
      Sunflower oil is also used in certain<br>
      cosmetic and domestic applications
