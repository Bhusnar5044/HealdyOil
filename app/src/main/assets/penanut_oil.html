    <h3>Peanut Oil:</h3>
    <font face="Arial" color="DIMGRAY">
      Peanut oil, also known by other names<br>
      such as groundnut oil and arachis oil,<br>
      is a type of vegetable oil commonly<br>
      used in cooking that is derived from peanuts.<br>
      It comes in a number of varieties,<br>
      including refined, unrefined, roasted,<br>
      and cold-pressed, which have slight<br>
      differences in their nutritional value<br>
      and health benefits. Generally, people<br>
      use peanut oil in their cooking for<br>
      the interesting flavor that it gives,<br>
      particularly the roasted variety,<br>
      as well as the fact that it is<br>
      healthier than many types of oil.

      De-hull the peanuts and clean them thoroughly<br>
      in warm water.<br>
      Puting the peanuts in a blender with three<br>
      tablespoons of warm water and blend until smooth,<br>
      like peanut butter.<br>
      Pour this mixture in a bowl and cover.<br>
      Refrigerate it for 24 hours, which will<br>
      allow the oil to rise. This will produce<br>
      at least one cup of oil.<br>
      Pour the oil into a strainer over a bowl,<br>
      separating the oil from the peanut mixture.<br>
      Transfer the oil to a jar, seal tightly with a lid,<br>
      and refrigerate.
